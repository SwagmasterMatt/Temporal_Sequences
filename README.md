# Interactive Visualization for Detecting Anomalies in Temporal Event Sequences

This project presents an interactive, browser-based visualization tool for detecting anomalies in temporal event sequences. It is designed to support audit and fraud detection tasks across various domains—such as HR data integrity, healthcare records, and financial operations—where chronological event analysis is critical.

The included visualization centers on a user-defined reference date and enables flexible reordering, interactive filtering, and pattern inspection through intuitive spline-based temporal plots.
